# Hello!

Welcome to my personal website. I built this site using Mkdocs, documentation as code, and GitHub resources. My intentions with this page are to document work and trainings that I have successfully completed to use as a resource as well as to benefit my career development.

## About Me

My name is Kaelyn Melton and I am glad you have decided to browse my page. 

I live in Arkansas with my husband and our son, who was born in May 2024. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, running, and spending time outdoors.

As for education, I hold the following degrees:

- Bachelor's of Science degree in Business Data Analytics
- Bachelor's of Science in Applied Statistics with Data Science
- Minor in Mathematics

Currently, I work as an Associate Professional Application Designer at Gainwell Technologies, where I have automated multiple reporting processes using Python, developed and maintained technical documentation, and contributed to project management. My role also involves conducting client training sessions and analyzing process automations to create valuable data insights and visualizations.

I have over two years of experience in data and process analysis. I am proficient in Python, Microsoft Office, and Git, and am skilled in technical documentation, data analysis, project management, and data visualization. I have a strong ability to communicate effectively and deliver results, with a focus on maintaining organization and accuracy in my work.
